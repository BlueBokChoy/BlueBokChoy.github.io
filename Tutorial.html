				<p class="blacktxtstyle">Are you craving the next door Mcdonalds? Or is the good ol' textbook
					feeling kinda meh? Well it seems like a great time to do some shenanigans. </p>
				<p class="blacktxtstyle">In this post, I'll share some of the tried and true methods for getting out of
					here.</p>
				<h4 class="subtitleblack">Tip 1: Lmao, you can't</h4>
				<p class="blacktxtstyle">You're stuck here and there's no escape. Experts say that the last stage to
					grief is acceptance, better accept that fact now... Besides, the vending machines here aren't that
					bad,
					right?</p>
				<h4 class="subtitleblack">Tip 2: Pay 4000 Dollars for the "touch grass" DLC</h4>
				<p class="blacktxtstyle">A very popular option among the gaming base of MMHS is to buy the new expansion
					packs and DLC for MMHS. It's a very effective option, however it only provides a free pass for 2
					hours.</p>
				<p class="blacktxtstyle">The outer bounds of MMHS is now available for purchase in the newly release DLC
					for 4000 smackeroos available now on the EA store (Ecentric Acorns). However we suggest that you
					wait
					into the Krazy Sale coming soon to purchase your copy at a discount.</p>
				<img class="img" src="Images/DLCs.png">
				<p class="blacktxtstyle">For a limited time as well, EA is introducing a in-game event skin. For those
					who buy the latest DLC, they get a copy of the clowns skin set and some horse armor (for the kicks I
					guess?). What a steal!</p>
				<h4 class="subtitleblack">Tip 3: Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM) </h4>
				<p class="blacktxtstyle">ICBMs are one of the easiest methods that we're going to be discussing here.
					All you need is some advanced rocket science, 118 Millions dollars in the bank, a clear lack of
					ethics
					(this ones easy), and some hard work.</p>
				<p class="blacktxtstyle">Since this method is so easy, I'll just quickly summerise the steps:
				<ul class="blacktxtstyle">
					<li>Find 1000Kg of </li>
					<li>Haha, did you really</li>
					<li>think I'd tell you how to</li>
					<li>make a bomb?</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<img class="img" src="Images/ICBM.jpg">
				<p class="blacktxtstyle">Just be warned though, you may violate a few international laws on the way, but
					why let that ruin some good fun? All you need to do is ignore the guys in black suits outside your
					door
					from the "CIA", whatever that is.
				</p>
				<h4 class="subtitleblack">Tip 4: Clean the washrooms</h4>
				<p class="blacktxtstyle">This method is widely regarded as the "freemium" method. Whilst techincally
					free, do
					you really want to?</p>
				<p class="blacktxtstyle">A very famous urban legend that thou who can reign over the washroom of the
					first floor may leave the school. Of course, many was tried but failed.</p>
				<p class="blacktxtstyle">Rest assured though that if you don't survive your encounter, your odyssey will
					still be told among students for generations to come.</p>
				<img class="img" src="Images/Washrooms.webp">
				<h4 class="subtitleblack">Tip 5: Confront the root of all problems</h4>
				<p class="blacktxtstyle">One common problem faced among students trying to escape the confines of this
					school is the root of all problems. Which has been turning your nice and innocent linear functions
					into something that barely grows.</p>
				<p class="blacktxtstyle">Say, we assign problems the variable "x", then the root of all problems we need
					to address is &#8730;x.</p>
				<p class="blacktxtstyle">Even worse, if you're feeling negative, you won't be able to confront him at
					all! He won't even be in the real world. He's a known liar as well, he'll say all your negative
					problems are imaginary.</p>
				<img class="img" src="Images/Insanegraph.png">
				<p class="blacktxtstyle">All in all, he's a terrible guy and I feel sorry for anyone trying to confront
					him.
				</p>
				<h4 class="subtitleblack">Conclusion</h4>
				<p class="blacktxtstyle">With so many methods of escaping the dull walls of MMHS, you'll never bored
					again! You can test your knowledge with our free interactive quiz.
